# BTransit-Flutter-Plus
## Inspiration
Almost everyone I have talked with, have had issues with the BT app at some point or another. its **very** unreliable and often has outages during peak times. My aim is to help everyone by making a new app that is more consistent, looks nicer, and has extra features that the current one does not have. 

## What it does

## How we built it
Flutter. Public API available for the live data. I just needed to ping the data and cache it to serve to users. the caching was done in a simple python server. Then set up the mobile app to have a map of Blacksburg. then get the route data and place that on the map as an overlay. 

## Challenges we ran into
I don't know flutter. The format of flutter is very different to JavaScript or more OOP styled languages. A lot of documentation and code examples are out of date. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In a very short time span, I was able to get started on a completely new language and implement many features and integrate my knowledge from other domains. 

## What we learned
How to make cross platform applications using flutter and dart. 

## What's next for Blacksburg Transit Plus
Implementing all the features that are not done yet. still a major WIP. 
Implement a __leaderboard__ system to promote the  use of public transit and reduce traffic. also reducing pollution.
